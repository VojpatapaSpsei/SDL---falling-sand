# SDL - falling-sand

## description
This is a "game" made with C, C++ and SDL2. you can create sand or destroy sand.

## controls
- make sand - left click on mouse.
- kill sand - right click on mouse.
- adjust scale of making and killing sand - scroll on mouse.

## technical description
- the quality of code and efficiency of the program were not taken into account when making it.
- to run .exe file, you need to have an image directory, .dll files and .exe file itself in the same directory.
- if you want to try editing it and run through, for example, Clion or Codeblocks, you probably won't succeed, because SDL2 setup is painful, but good luck.
